# ghnotificationfeedback


- about me - FE Software Engineer at RedEye Apps 
- Use gh notifications daily / hourly / as soon as have break in between tasks 
- Enjoy looking code across repo / apps / projects and will contribute in providing feedback or updated title/descriptions/ missing labels

## Bell icon with indicator

top right bell notification icon with little blue circle - mail status unread

 
## Notification Page original vs Beta Desktop vs iPhone App

### Original (opt in)
- unread notification by default 
- divided by repository that i am watching
- provide good overview summary of current activities per projects/repo 
- can then scan through 
- better context (a bit like readng a Heading then move onto reading paragraph or dot points
#### actions (one click essential)
- Mark all as read - All repositories
- Mark all as read - Single repository
- Mark as read - single notification

### Beta desktop (early opt out)
- read/unread is good
- fitler notification by keyword expect items to be sorted by keywords providing more importance 
- missing repositiory contexts (more like a email inbox systems vs checklist/todo notification)
#### actions (more steps, and clicks)
- missing Mark all as read - All repositories
- missing Mark all as read - Single repository
- require checking checkboxes per items and use drop down select to mark as read

### iPhone App (different label and approach, require familiarity with new learning)
- missing read/unread filter
- mark as done
#### actions 
- missing Mark all as read - All repositories
- missing Mark all as read - Single repository
- missing Mark as read - single notification
- require swaping item right for done and left for save
- label done seem a new concept introduce in beta 


## Notification daily, hourly routine
if nothing attracting attention > Mark all as read

- check daily mostly company projects code base front end / backend
accross most activity 

rarely save for later...

## Usage 

Usually look for any new notification that require:
- contributing in review code an give feedback
- updating my code based on others feedback and recommendations
- also interested in other repository contributions for learning, curiosity, be kept updated on progress,
 
### examples
- Accross all repositories at work -> all disciplines Front end, Backend, DevOps code contributions 
- Personal repo -> security vulnerability 
- Open Source -> RFC (request for comments), other comments
