1. top right bell notification icon with little blue circle - mail status unread
2. unread notification by default 
3. divided by repository that i am watching 
 
provide good overview summary of current activities per projects/repo 
can then scan through - better context (a bit like readng a Heading then move onto reading paragraph or dot points

if nothing attracting attention > Mark all as read

daily mostly company projects code base front end / backend
accross most activity 

Mark all as read - All repositories
Mark all as read - Single repository
Mark as read - single notificaiton

rarely save for later...

Usually look for any new notification that require:
- contribute in reviewing code an give feedback
- update my code based on others feedback
- interest in other repository contributions for learning, curiosity, be kept updated on progress,
- 

Accross all Work repo -> all Front end, Backend, DevOps code contributions 
Personal repo -> security vulnerability 
Open Source -> RFC (request for comments), other comments
